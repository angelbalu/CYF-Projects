    <strong>Step 1:</strong>
    Drain the chickpeas, add to a large pan with 400ml of water and season. Bring to the boil, then turn off the heat
    and set aside to allow the chickpea flavour to infuse the water.<br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong>
    Blitz the onions with the garlic, ginger and green chillies. Melt the ghee in a large saucepan, then add the onion
    mix with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 mins, until softened.<br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong>
    Stir in the spices, and cook for 3 more mins, adding a splash of the chickpea water to stop them sticking to the
    bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes and another splash of water and cook for 5 mins, squishing the tomatoes with a
    spoon as they soften. Tip in the chickpeas, along with their cooking water. Cook for 10 mins. Season well, add the
    lemon juice, and a splash of water if you like a looser curry. Scatter with the coriander, to serve.
